we are trying to fingerprint users based off something, what information can we use?
- asn
- resolver information
- software name
- engine version
- time information across multiple days
- annotaions->include information about the users device when they ran the probe

we should probably use a combination of various fields
(we might use one column to get a smaller subset of users and then explore from there)

we need to use later data becausse it has more information in the annotation (user device)

run our own ooni probes and see if we can see we can see who it is

a lot of research cross validates across other datasets and also has information about which users did what
